# Back-End-Developer-Capstone
META Back-End Developer Course Capstone Project

By working through the lessons in this course, you revisited the necessary concepts and knowledge of back-end development. Using the Django REST Framework, you put your skills into practice to build an API for the Little Lemon restaurant.

You completed exercises, received general instructions and code snippets, and utilized links to resources from previous courses to complete this task.

You demonstrated your web development skills by writing code to create an API that handles table bookings for the Little Lemon restaurant.

The API can receive HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, and updates the Django models, which in turn, updates the data in a MySQL database.

Now, you will participate in a peer review exercise in which you will submit your completed project for two of your peers to review. 

You will also be required to review a project of two of your peers.

The grading criteria are covered in more detail below.

Review criteria
less 
When you submit your assignment, other learners in the course will review and grade your work. They will evaluate the following:

Does the web application use Django to serve static HTML content?

Has the learner committed the project to a Git repository?

Does the application connect the backend to a MySQL database?

Are the menu and table booking APIs implemented?

Is the application set up with user registration and authentication?

Does the application contain unit tests?

Can the API be tested with the Insomnia REST client?

How to submit your project
less 
Your project will be built using the VS Code editor in your local development environment, but your code will be stored in a GitHub repository.

In the Git repository, add a Readme.txt file. Inside the Readme.txt file, add the API paths that you want your peers to test. An example could look like the following:

12
/api/bookings/
/api/registration/
Note: Make sure you commit and push the Readme.txt file to your GitHub repository.

When you are happy that the code is working and you have tested the project, you must perform the following steps to make the project available for your peers to review.

Step 1:

Click on the My submission tab

Step 2:

Provide a Project Title for example, Back-end developer capstone project

Step 3:

Paste the URL of the GitHub repository that contains your capstone project code
